Sometimes we want to rush design.

Makes sense, time contraints are real and deadlines are always going to exist.

But there is a lot of value in allowing ingrediants to simmer for a day or two before the final evaluation of the design.

If you rush something when a simmer is preferred, you lose flavor. It's impossible to rush that recipe without losing the quality that comes from allowing it to sit.

With design, you can make something that looks really good/or really shitty in a day and then you take a look at it the next day and could completely look the opposite.

By allowing designs to simmer more, we're able to let the ingegdiants breathe in our mind and approach it again with fresher senses than before.

Try it.

Stop rushing flavor.
