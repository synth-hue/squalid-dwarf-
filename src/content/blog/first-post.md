When I think about the act of showing up, I think about the daily habit of brushing teeth.

Some days it's a breeze, others it takes more effort to get it done. But over time the effects are clear when a dentist can tell if you're brushing daily or not.

Brushing something is better than no brushing.

Showing up to do the work before us is all that it takes.

Do whatever you can to show up; then do the best you can.

But please, show up.
