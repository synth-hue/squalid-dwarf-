I made this clunky old space for posts because I wanted an area to share my thoughts without them being vary polished and hot takey.

I'm using Astro to build all these pages and sites along side publishing with Netlify.

Coding this is difficult, but I wanted to force minimal execuation so I wouldn't waste time tweaking things.

So this isn't starting out pretty, but it's forcing me to move slowly while being commited to posting more here.

Who knows if it will last but I'm kind just doing this because I need some catharsis from all the stress in my life.
