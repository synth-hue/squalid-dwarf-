One of the most surprising peieces of trauma I have had to still carry after getting a fulltime role after being freelance for a year, is the fear of being liad off again.

The extereme shock of being told I was being laid off still exisits to vividily in my mind currently that it's exremely hard not to be paraniod of it happening again.

Some weeks are better than others, but a lot of weeks the terror and addidtional stress is there.

Questions come up like; “am I doing my job well enough”, “I made a mistake, is this it?”, or “companies never really do care about employess; it's all about $$$”, play constantly in my head.

I'm not sure if I"ll ever get over this, but I feel for everyone who has been laid of during these crazy times and I feel for them when the scaries continue even after an offer is accpeted.
